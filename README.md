# good-kind-of-projections

Some fun with pin hole projections of 3d bodies to a 2d screen, using Canvas and JavaScript.
Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjWkNZ0SXfo) of tsoding.

Additionally I added the functionality of: 
- a moving camera around the x, y and z axis
- camera rotation around the x and y axis

Features to add:
  - Input legend
  - More shapes within the world
